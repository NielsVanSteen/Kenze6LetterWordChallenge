## Info
1. Project uses .NET 7
2. The input.txt file is located in the default directory used when running the program in debug mode: \Kenze6LetterWordChallenge\Kenze6LetterWordChallenge\bin\Debug\net7
3. The text file for the unit test is also located in the /bin/Debug/... folder of the unit test project.
4. I excluded the /bin/Debug folder from the .gitignore so the input.txt file should still be there. If not edit the path in Program.cs or paste the input.txt file there.
