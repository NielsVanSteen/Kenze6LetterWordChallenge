# 6LetterWordChallenge

## Info
1. Project uses .NET 7
2. The solution has 2 projects, 1 for the unit tests (Unit Test Project), and the other for the actual challenge (Console App Project). After cloning the repository just run Program.cs.
3. The input.txt file is located in the default directory used when running the program in debug mode: \Kenze6LetterWordChallenge\Kenze6LetterWordChallenge\bin\Debug\net7
4. The text file for the unit tests is also located in the /bin/Debug/... folder of the unit test project.
5. I excluded the /bin/Debug folder from the .gitignore so the input.txt file should still be there. If not (or when not running the project in debug mode) edit the path in Program.cs or paste the input.txt file there.
